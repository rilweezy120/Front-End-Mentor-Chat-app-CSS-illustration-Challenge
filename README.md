## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt and practiced for the first time using linear gradient to mix two or more colors together, I also leant the trasnform property which was pretty handy in place of the margin property.

### Continued development
I would continue developing my skills maybe taking on projects that incorprate javascript
